# Learning Note For React
    The setup procedure for the modern front-end development is too complicated, However, thanks to the create-react-app project, we can setup a well organized react project in a seconds. (I feel it is quite similar to the ruby on rail :) ). Hence, my learning note is based on the create-react-app setup.
## Project Structure
I am not familiar with the front-end techniques, However, The react project structure looks quite similar to a traditional compile and run project. (May be ios :)). I am quite interesting in that may be react can even compile our code into the webAssemble?
- package.json: dependencies, version, name, etc.
- node_modules: dependency files 
- **src**: modifiable code
  - index.js: main Render Call from ReactDOM (like the main function in c, and java)
  - index.css: the base styling for application
  - App.js: a demo app js (Maybe deleted)
  - App.css: the styling for the App
  - App.test.js: the for the App.js
## Concepts
- ES2015: ECMAScript 2015 is an ECMAScript standard that was ratified in June 2015. (Seems to be the standard javascript used)
- JSX: A Preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript.
